1. At Each Time-Step:
    
    Identify Demand: Look at the demand for each type of server (e.g.,S CPU.S1, GPU.1) and its latency sensitivity (high or low) for the current time-step.
    Prioritize High-Latency Demand: Allocate resources to meet the high-latency demand first, as this typically requires more careful consideration of where servers are deployed (in low-latency data centers).
    Allocate Low-Latency Demand: Once high-latency demand is met, allocate resources to handle low-latency demand.

2. Allocate Resources to Data Centers:
    
    Match Latency Requirements: Assign servers to data centers that match the latency requirements of the demand. For example, allocate high-latency-sensitive demand to data centers with low latency.
    Check Slot Capacity: Ensure that the data center has enough available slots to accommodate the servers being assigned. If a data center is full, move to the next best option.
    Deploy Servers: Deploy the servers to the selected data centers, updating the available slots and capacity of the data centers accordingly.

3. Update System State:
    
    Track Server Usage:Keep track of which servers are deployed where, how much of their capacity is used, and their remaining lifespan.
    Monitor Data Center Load: Ensure that data centers are not over-allocated, and adjust as necessary for future time-steps.
